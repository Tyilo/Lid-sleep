This is useless
===============

Run `sudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0` instead and it works. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/84663/6439


Lid-sleep
=========

Automatically put a MacBook to sleep when closing the lid with an external screen attached.

This used to default behavior in OS X, but was changed in Lion, without any option to change it back.
